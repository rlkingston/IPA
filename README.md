# IPA 
***I**terative **P**rojection **A**lgorithms for protein crystallography*

A program for *ab initio* phase determination and phase improvement.


# Overview

+ The program is capable of *ab initio* phase determination for protein crystals with high solvent content (solvent fraction > 70%) 

+ It can also be used to generate plausible molecular envelopes for crystals with much lower solvent content.

The only required input are the measured diffraction data (in a CCP4 mtz file) and and estimate for the solvent fraction of the crystal.
