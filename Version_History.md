+ Envelope and phase determination steps are parallelized.

# Version  1.1.0

Major changes

+ Envelope comparison and clustering now allows for inversion symmetry.
+ The way the apodization function is specified has changed.
+ Checks on the magnitude of missing terms are now based entirely on the Wilson model. 
+ Agreement of the data with the Wilson model is reported.
+ New procedures introduced for controlling the amplitudes of missing data during Fourier space projection onto the constraints  
+ A much more flexible method of defining the update rules and constraints was introduced. 
+ During DBSCAN clustering of envelopes, "k-distances" are now evaluated. Optionally use the k-distance distribution to set threshold value Îµ. 
+ Internal handling of Fourier data was reworked. Fourier coefficients beyond the current "effective resolution limit" are now removed, speeding up the calculations with heavily apodized data.
+ Ouput from analysis of overall scale and B-factor (method of Rogers) is now reported in the summary log file for the job.
+ Parameterization of the envelope determination step has changed, significantly improving algorithm performance for some test cases.
